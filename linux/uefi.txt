====== UEFI ======

On Linux, if you want to remove old or obsolete boot entries from your UEFI boot menu, you can use the ''efibootmgr'' command. Here's how:

List Boot Entries:
  * Open a terminal window.
  * Run the following command to list the current boot entries:

<code bash>
efibootmgr
</code>

This will display a list of boot entries along with their indices (numbers).

Identify the entry to remove: Look for the entry corresponding to the operating system you want to remove. Note its index (usually a hexadecimal number).

Delete the Entry: To delete an entry, use the ''-b'' option followed by the index of the entry you want to remove. For example:

<code bash>
sudo efibootmgr -b XXXX -B
</code>

Replace XXXX with the actual index of the entry you want to delete.

Verify Changes:After running the command, check the boot menu again to ensure that the unwanted entry has been removed.
