===== How to clear Nextcloud AIO logs =====

You need to truncate the logs file, like this:

<code=bash>
sudo truncate -s 0 /var/lib/docker/volumes/nextcloud_aio_nextcloud/_data/data/nextcloud.log
</code>

Sometimes Nextcloud also creates an extra logs file, the location of which can be found in the ''config.php'' file. For example, it might be in ''.Nextcloud-data/nextcloud.log''.
