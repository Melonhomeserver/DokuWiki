====== YT-DLP ======

===== Youtube downloader =====

First, enter the python virtual environment where yt-dlp is installed!

To download songs in mp3 320K format and metadata:

<code bash>
yt-dlp -x --audio-format mp3 --audio-quality 320K --embed-metadata https://youtubelink.com
</code>

Double check the metadata tho. Artist, Album and Song name are correct, usually other things are missing. You can also link Youtube Music.
