# Attachment

Back in the day, one of the main ideas was that dependency is to be discouraged, while self-sufficiency is to be congratulated and encouraged. These ideas contradict some basic principles of how our social brain is wired - and specifically that we are programmed to create strong close connections and to rely on others for our emotional wellbeing.

## Tamara’s Tale: A Case Study of Emotional Turmoil and Its Impact

From Tamara's experience:

> "[...] I could no longer control my emotions. I didn't know how to act, and despite my better judgment, I'd avoid making plans with friends in case he called. I completely lost interest in everything else that was important to me"

Her friends noticed that most of the time she was either waiting for a call from Greg or too worried and preoccupied about the relationship to enjoy spending time with them as she had done in the past. It became apparent that her work was also suffering, and she expressed some concern that she may lose her job.

## The Dependency Paradox: Unraveling the Misconceptions of Neediness and Independence

People go under the basic assumption that they can and should control their own emotional needs and soothe themselves in the face of stress. But, as Adult Attachment Theory shows, this is simply wrong. Getting attached means that our brain becomes wired to seek the support of our partner by ensuring the partner's psychological and physical proximity.

Attachment principles teach us that most people are only as needy as their unmet needs. When their emotional needs are met, they usually turn their attention outward. This is sometimes referred to as the "dependency paradox": The more effectively dependent people are on one another, the more independent and daring they become.

## Anxious type

You love to be very close to your romantic partners and have the capacity for great intimacy. You often fear, however, that your partner does not wish to be as close as you would like him/her to be. Relationships tend to consume a large part of your emotional energy. You tend to be very sensitive to small fluctuations in your partner's moods and actions, and although your senses are often accurate, you take your partner's behaviours too personally. 
You experience a lot of negative emotions within the relationship and get easily upset. As a result, you tend to act out and say things you later regret. 
If the other person provides a lot of security and reassurance, however, you are able to shed much of your preoccupation and feel contented.

\[...] when you are excited about someone, your objectivity is compromised and you tend to create a rosy picture of him or her.

*"All happiness or unhappiness solely depends upon the quality of the object to which we are attached by love"* -cit. Baruch Spinoza

### Balancing Vigilance and Patience

If you have an anxious attachment style, you possess a unique ability to sense when your relationship is threatened. Even a slight hint that something may be wrong will activate your attachment system, and once it's activated, you are unable to calm down until you get a clear indication from your partner that he or she is truly there for you and that the relationship is safe.

People with other attachment styles also get activated, but they don't pick up on subtle details that people with an anxious attachment style do.

\[...] people with an anxious attachment style are indeed more vigilant to changes in other's emotional expression and can have a higher degree of accuracy and sensitivity to other people's cues. However \[...] they tend to jump to conclusions very quickly, and when they do, they tend to misinterpret people's emotional state.

This is an important lesson for someone with an anxious attachment style: If you just wait a little longer before reacting and jumping to conclusions, you will have an uncanny ability to decipher the world around you and use it to your advantage. 
Once activated, they are often consumed with thoughts that have a single purpose: to reestablish closeness with their partner. These thoughts are called activating strategies. Once she responds to you in a way that reestablishes security, you can revert back to your calm, normal self.

## The working of the attachment system

Many people with anxious attachment style live with a chronically activated attachment system without realizing it. "Her thoughts, feelings, and beaviours were governed by the fact that David was not truly available to her. She felt an almost constant sense of threat to the relationship.

Protest behavior is any action that tries to reestablish contact with your partner and get their attention. \[...] anything that can jolt the other person into noticing you and responding to you.

## Finding a good relationship when you are anxious

Emily was unware that she had an anxious attachment style. If she had known, she would have understood that being anxious means that she thrives on intimate, supportive relationships that are stable and long-lasting, and that uncertainty and emotional unavailability get her activated and preoccupied, or in a word, miserable.

Avoidant individuals actually prefer anxiously attached people. 

It is possible, then, that people who guard their independence with ferocity would seek the partners most likely to impinge on their autonomy? Or that people who seekcloseness are attracted to people who want to push them away? And if so, why?
Pietromonaco and Carnelley believe that these attachment styles actually complement each other in a way. Each reaffirms the other's beliefs about themselves and about relationships.
The avoidant's defensive self-perception that they are strong and independent is confirmed, as is the belief that others want to pull them into more closeness than they are comfortable with. The anxious types find that their perception of wanting more intimacy than their partner can provide is confirmed, as is their anticipation of ultimately being let down by significant others.

You start to equate the anxiety, the preoccupation, the obsession, and those ever-so-short bursts of joy with love. 
True love, in the evolutionary sense, means peace of mind.
If you are anxious, you shouldn't be dating someone avoidant.

The key to finding a mate who can fulfill those needs is to first fully acknowledge your need for intimacy, availability, and security in a relationship - and to believe that they are legitimate. They aren't good or bad, they are simply your needs. Don't let people make you feel guilty for acting "needy" or "dependent". Don't be ashamed of feeling incomplete when you're not in a relationship, or for wanting to be close to your partner and to depend on him.

*"I love you very much; I need to know that you are there for me all the time. I want to know I can talk to you every day and not just when it's convenient for you. I don't want to have to cover up my wish to spend time with you for fear of driving you away*

### The abundance philosophy

Once your attachment system is activated, you begin to crave the other person's closeness and will do anything in your power to make it work even before you really get to know him/her and decide whether you like that person or not.

By using the abundance philosophy, you maintain your ability to evaluate potential partners more objectively. What you are actually doing is desensitizing your attachment system and tricking it into being easier on you. You system will no longer get so easily activated by one person because it will be busy evaluating the availability of a lot of different people, and you won't be as likely to obsess about anyone in particular.

# The avoidant attachment style

*"Happiness is only real when shared"*

If you are avoidant, you connect with romantic partners bur always maintain some mental distance and an escape route. Feeling close and complete with someone else - the emotional equivalent of finding a home - is a condition that you find difficult to accept.

# The secure attachment style

People with a secure attachment style, like Stan, are characterized by something very real but not outwardly visible - they are programmed to expect their partners to be loving and responsive and don't worry much about losing their partners love. They feel extremely comfortable with intimacy and closeness and have an uncanny ability to communicate their needs and respond to their partner needs.

Even if there is a correlation between attachment style in childhood and in adulthood, it is weak at best. An entire mosaic of factors comes together to create this attachment pattern: our early connection with our parents, our genes, and also something else - our romantic experiences as adults.

### Tapping into the secure mindset

You too can provide a secure base by adopting the following secure behaviours:
- Be available: Respond sensitively to their distress, allow them to be dependent on you when they feel the need, check in with them from time to time, and provide comfort when things go wrong.
- Don't interfere: Provide behind the scenes support for their endeavors. Help in a way that leaves them with the initiative and the feeling of power. Allow them to do their own thing without trying to take over the situation, micromanage or undermine their confidence and abilities.
- Encourage: Provide encouragement and be accepting of their learning and personal growth goals. Boost their self-esteem.

### Finding the right partner, the secure way

The principles we advocate throughout this book for finding the right partner include:
- Spotting "smoking guns" very ealy on and treating them as a deal breakers.
- Effectively communicating your needs from day one.
- Subscribing to the belief that there are many (yes, many) potential partners who could make you happy.
- Never taking blame for a date's offensive behaviour. When a partner acts inconsiderately or hurtfully, secures acknowledge that it says a lot about the other person rather than about themselves.
- Expecting to be treated with respect, dignity, love.

### Are secure people immune to relationship problems?

Secure adults naturally know how to soothe their partners and take care of them - it's an innate talent.

"Forgiveness requires difficult regulatory maneuvers... understanding a transgressor's needs and motives, and making generous attributions and appraisals concerning the transgresso's traits and hurtful actions. Secure people are likely to offer relatively benign explanations of their partners hurtful actions and be inclined to forgive the partner.

# The anxious - avoidant trap

While one partner truly want intimacy, the other feels very uncomfortable when things become too close. This is the case when one partner is avoidant and the other anxious.
The reason people in an anxious - avoidant relationship find it particularly hard to move toward more security is primarily because they are trapped in a cycle of exacerbating each other's insecurities. People with an anxious attachment style cope with threats to relationship by activating their attachment system - trying to get close to their partner. People who are avoidant cope with threats by deactivating - taking measures to distance themselves from their partners and "turn off" their attachment system. thus, the closer the anxious tries to get, the more distant the avoidant acts. To make matters worse, one partner's activation further reinforces the other's deactivation in a vicious cycle, and they both remain within the relationship "danger zone".

### Telltale signs of the anxious - avoidant trap
- The roller-coaster effect. In the relationship you never sail along on an even keel. Instead, every once in a while, when the avoidant partner makes him/herself available to the anxious partner, the latter's attachment system is temporarily quieted and you achieve extreme closeness - leading to the feeling of a "high". this closeness, however, is perceived as a threat by the avoidant partner and is quickly followed by withdrawal on his or her part - only to create renewed dissatisfaction for the anxious partner.
- Stable instability. The relationship may last for a long time, but an element of uncertainty persists.
- Are we really fighting about this? You may beel that you're constantly fighting about things you shouldn't be fighting about at all. In fact, your fights aren't about these minors problems but about something else altogether - the amount of intimacy between you two.
- Experiencing the trap. You develop the eerie sense that the relationship is not right for you, but you feel too emotionally connected to the other person to leave.

### Why are intimacy differences so difficult to reconcile?

If two people are in love, can't they find a way to be togheter and work out their differences?
Typically, if the relationship runs its usual course, despite differing intimacy needs, the anxious partner is usually the one who has to make concessions and accpet the rules imposed by the avoidant partner.

- Intimacy differences can spill over into more and more areas of life.
- With every clash, the anxious person loses more ground: during bitter fights between anxious and avoidant partners, when there are no secure checks and balances in place, people with anxious attachment style tend to get overwhelmed by negative amotions. When they feel hurt, they talk, think, and act in an extreme manner, even to the point of threatening to leave (protest behaviour).
  However, once they calm down, they become flooded with positive memories and are then overcome with regret. They reach out to their partner in an attempt to reconcile. But they are often met with a hostile response, because avoidants react differently to a fight. They turn off all attachment - related memories and remember the worst of their partner.

## Reshaping your working models

In attachment research, "working model" is a phrase that describes our basic belief system when it comes to romantic relationships - what gets you going, what shuts you down, your attitudes and expectations. In short, what makes you tick in relationships.
